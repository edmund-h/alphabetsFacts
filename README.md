# alphabetsFacts

Something I created to practice using Tableviews and collection cells. A simple tableview displays true alphabets of currently existing language groups. Touching a button with a sample character will lead to a collection view displaying all characters in the alphabet and facts about the alphabet. Upon returning, a checkmark will apear signifying that the info has been read.
